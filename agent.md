### What is an agent?

- AI agents are programs where LLM outputs the workflow.
- Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
- Agents are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they
  accomplish tasks.
